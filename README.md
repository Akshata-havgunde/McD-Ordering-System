# McD-Ordering-System
McOrderBot is a fun and interactive Python-based console application that simulates a McDonald's-style food ordering experience. Users can browse through a detailed menu, place multiple orders, and view a final billâ€”all within a command-line interface. This project demonstrates control flow, dictionaries, functions, and user input handling in Python.
